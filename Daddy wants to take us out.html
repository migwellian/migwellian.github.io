Daddy wants to take us out
    </div>
Daddy wants to take us out
</br>
He says it’s time to leave.
</br>
He says it’s crowded in the house
</br>
There isn’t room to breathe.
</br>

</br>
Daddy wants to take us out
</br>
The landlord wants his rent.
</br>
But the kitchen ceiling’s leaking
</br>
And the bannisters are bent.
</br>

</br>
Daddy wants to take us out
</br>
He needs to find some work.
</br>
His job’s done by a robot now
</br>
And managed by a Turk.
</br>

</br>
Daddy wants to take us out
</br>
But Mummy’s not so sure
</br>
She says it’s safer here at home
</br>
There’s wolves outside the door.
</br>

</br>
Daddy took us out today
</br>
But now he’s lost the keys
</br>
He left them on the windowsill
</br>
And Mummy isn’t pleased.
</br>

</br>
Daddy’s sleeping in the road
</br>
And Mummy’s on the kerb
</br>
But I’m not scared, ‘cause Daddy says
</br>
The outlook is superb.
