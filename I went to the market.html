I went to the market
    </div>
I went to the market to buy a loaf of bread
</br>
But the farmer didn’t have any, and gravely shook his head.
</br>
“Nobody sells wheat these days, there’s none to buy” he said,
</br>
“I make double what I used to, selling butter now instead”
</br>

</br>
“But butter isn’t what I need, I’ve mouths to feed” I cried
</br>
The farmer simply shook his head and crossed his arms and sighed.
</br>
He threw his butter on a pile a hundred miles wide
</br>
Then he climbed up to the very top and hurtled down a slide.
